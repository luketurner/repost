This tutorial will walk you through getting started with using the Repost CLI tool.

# Installation

To use `repost` on the CLI, it must be added to your PATH. If you install with the `-g` flag, it will be added to your PATH automatically:

```
npm install -g luketurner/repost
```

> **Note:** Repost is not distributed via NPM and is not semantically versioned (yet). The above command will download the latest version from Github `master` branch.

Now you can run `repost`:

```
repost --help
```

Repost's core function is to execute HTTP requests with `repost run`. HTTP requests can be declared in a variety of formats, the simplest of which is just pasting an HTTP request into a file with a `.http` extension.
